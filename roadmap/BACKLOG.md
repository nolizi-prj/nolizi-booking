# BACKLOG — what gets built next, in order

**Owned by the product-manager role** ([`pumasi-ops/roles/product-manager.md`](https://github.com/pumasi-ai/pumasi-ops/blob/main/roles/product-manager.md), duty 5).
First pass 2026-08-29, steward-directed.

One list, features and bugs together — a priority that cannot compare them is
not a priority. Every entry points at its source and carries one line of
why-here. **The top of this file is what the project manager's next coder
packet builds.** Reordering is a commit with the reasoning in the message; the
steward vetoes by reverting.

Context the ordering assumes: the feature-parity sequence in
[`0004-feature-parity.md` §3](0004-feature-parity.md) is substantially
**delivered** — engine, service, calendar truth (Google + Microsoft), limits,
recurrence, teams/round-robin, routing, polls, workflows/API, enterprise
identity, branding ([`service/spec/0002/SPEC.md` §8.1](../service/spec/0002/SPEC.md);
commit series `46abaf3`…`b0cb050`). What remains is mostly evidence, access,
and polish, and the list reflects that.

---

## The order

**1 · CHARTER §5.1 reporting path and opt-out** — source:
[`DEBT.md` D-108](https://github.com/pumasi-ai/pumasi/blob/main/governance/DEBT.md),
with the retention schedule of D-107 published alongside.
Why here: D-108's own trigger is "any release after this one," so nothing
below this line can release before it exists; it is also the only way the test
matrix ever gets wider than one machine.

**2 · Microsoft sign-in at the front door** — source:
[issue #5](https://github.com/pumasi-ai/pumasi-booking/issues/5)
(`enhancement, accepted`, priority: normal).
Why here: the Microsoft 365 *calendar* adapter shipped (`8f9174c`); sign-in is
the missing half of that pair, and the front door currently favours Google
accounts. Needs its own Microsoft OAuth registration.

**3 · Submit the Google OAuth app for verification** — source:
[`0002-calendar-integration.md` §4](0002-calendar-integration.md);
[`service/spec/0003/GOOGLE-SETUP.md`](../service/spec/0003/GOOGLE-SETUP.md)
("Not yet — deliberately").
Why here: calendar truth is the product's central promise and today only
nominated test accounts can connect; the blockers the setup doc waited on — a
deployed homepage and a live privacy URL — now exist. *Mostly operator/steward
action, not code; queue it in parallel, since it is calendar time, not work.*

**4 · A runtime subprocessor guard for the deployed mail path, or a recorded
why-not** — source: [`SUBPROCESSORS.md`](../SUBPROCESSORS.md), which names the
Workers path's control as weaker than the Node path's.
Why here: [`VALUE.md`](VALUE.md) C4 claims enforcement, and the deployed path
is the one real bookers' mail actually crosses.

**5 · O2 — secrets posture, completed** — source:
[`service/spec/0002/SPEC.md` §8.1](../service/spec/0002/SPEC.md), the last
clause declared but not implemented.
Why here: small, and it closes the spec's only admitted gap; below the
user-facing items because no user can currently be hurt by it.

## Completed (2026-08-29)

- **Microsoft sign-in at the front door** — [issue #5](https://github.com/pumasi-ai/pumasi-booking/issues/5) (closed via commit `66c93e9`).
- **Video chat integration (Meet, Teams, Zoom)** — [issue #4](https://github.com/pumasi-ai/pumasi-booking/issues/4) (closed via commit `66c93e9`).
- **Favicon not visible in the browser tab** — [issue #3](https://github.com/pumasi-ai/pumasi-booking/issues/3) (closed via commit `bb1825c`).
- **The first page needs to look better** — [issue #6](https://github.com/pumasi-ai/pumasi-booking/issues/6) (closed via commit `bb1825c` / `8fe4fce`).

## Held, not ordered

- **Counsel review and the transfer position** —
  [`DEBT.md` D-105](https://github.com/pumasi-ai/pumasi/blob/main/governance/DEBT.md):
  a `HUMAN.md` item; agents have drafted everything around it. Gates
  `launched` in [`STAGE.md`](STAGE.md), not any build below.
- **Payments; AI scheduling suggestions** — excluded by steward decision
  2026-08-01 ([`0004-feature-parity.md` §3](0004-feature-parity.md)); listed so
  their absence reads as a decision, not an omission.
